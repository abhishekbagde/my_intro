## Personal Bio

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym (I can deadlift 180 kgs!), cycling, watching Netflix, and experimenting in the kitchen. I’m also a skilled barista and love making coffee for friends. Additionally, I was a **national-level badminton player** back in India, and I still enjoy playing whenever I can.  

I’ve always wanted to learn horse riding, and I’m excited to say that I’m planning to start horse riding lessons soon. Meeting new people and building meaningful connections is something I genuinely enjoy.

I dream of traveling the world one day, and my ultimate retirement plan is to open a cozy little café and bakery in the countryside of Spain.
